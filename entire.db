{"c":"q/'At the core of the social agenda of the new urbanism, it is possible to identify two quite different and, at times, contradictory ideals. On one hand, there is the ideal of community, with its rhetoric of solidarity based on common feeling and personal connection. On the other hand, there is a loosely connected set of ideals that is com- monly summed up under the heading of urbanism, with its rhetoric of vital diver- sity, the normative order of the public realm, and civic idealism.2 In the effort to defend the value of what they propose, many new urbanist practitioners fall prey to ambiguities in the rhetoric of community as it is used in popular discourse. It is the rhetoric of community that has probably created most of the problems, rendering the new urbanists susceptible to the critique of communitarianism and ill prepared to defend against the criticism that it is insensitive to some of the most significant challenges of the city: namely, problems of race, class, and social equity.\"//David Brain, \"From Good Neighborhoods to Sustainable Cities: Social Science and the Social Agenda of the New Urbanism\", International Regional Science Review No. 28, 2005, 217-238.\n","p":{"x":348,"y":3442},"t":0,"u":22,"r":[23,23],"d":[2020,6,18,12,8,34],"db":"test","_id":"7PE6sqnL8dxf3uYI"}

To ask merely whether global production of goods and services can be increased to meet future demands in a sustainable way misses much of the question. For example, food scarcity manifests itself locally, so efforts to alleviate it must be tailored to local circumstances. To do otherwise is akin to treating a sick person on the basis of global health statistics.
