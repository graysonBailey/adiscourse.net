{"c":"r/ as it relates to Foucault's points on power being available only in the weakness of domination, a hegemonic formation would need to have a live system of reinforcement against power potentials from these strands of discourse coming together. I think this is only exacerbated with Laclau and Mouffe's idea of 'surplus of meaning', so there is never a statically stable domination without out some presence of power potential. Obviously, this would suggest that the dominating classes best modus operandi would revolve around being best positioned to take advantage of power potentials, rather than attempting to avoid them.","p":{"x":843,"y":7308},"t":0,"u":84,"r":[85],"d":[2020,6,3,21,41,50],"db":"discursive","_id":"0kYyqZiCISVlwPQZ"}
