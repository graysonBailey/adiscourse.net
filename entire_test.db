But this also gives a strange dialogue - one product (a book on Marx) can only be discursively matched in style by another product of the same type (another book on a subject related to Marx). Even book reviews don't count as a similar discursive product, though they develop a different form of symbiotic discursive products.

{"c":"q/'At the core of the social agenda of the new urbanism, it is possible to identify two quite different and, at times, contradictory ideals. On one hand, there is the ideal of community, with its rhetoric of solidarity based on common feeling and personal connection. On the other hand, there is a loosely connected set of ideals that is commonly summed up under the heading of urbanism, with its rhetoric of vital diver- sity, the normative order of the public realm, and civic idealism.2 In the effort to defend the value of what they propose, many new urbanist practitioners fall prey to ambiguities in the rhetoric of community as it is used in popular discourse. It is the rhetoric of community that has probably created most of the problems, rendering the new urbanists susceptible to the critique of communitarianism and ill prepared to defend against the criticism that it is insensitive to some of the most significant challenges of the city: namely, problems of race, class, and social equity.\"//David Brain, \"From Good Neighborhoods to Sustainable Cities: Social Science and the Social Agenda of the New Urbanism\", International Regional Science Review No. 28, 2005, 217-238.\n","p":{"x":348,"y":3442},"t":0,"u":22,"r":[23,23],"d":[2020,6,18,12,8,34],"db":["test"],"_id":"7PE6sqnL8dxf3uYI"}
