      <span style="color:black !important">
        This space is an experiment and possibly an aberation. It is a space of indeterminate written discourse "on the network" or maybe "in network" or perhaps "through the network". Within the browser portal units of discourse from books and
        articles and types of references are mixed with units of the mind. Rather than some impulse towards finding a clear and thoroughly organized result from various submissions, the discontinuous aggregate is quite the point - a mediation without composition.
      </span>
      <span style="color:black !important">
        <b>[discourse] </b> : in broad strokes, {adiscourse.net} is an examination of the various material and immaterial practices of discourse - between one user and another, but also between client and server. The examination of discourse is important to every separated "discipline", and we should be finding better ways for producing discourse than new book deals, overwrought conferences or social media signaling. New moments will require specific losses - the validations of likes or editorial acceptance, and must reach further into how we use technology to build and ruin ideas in a slow real-time.
      </span>
      <span style="color:black !important">
        <b>[states]</b> : traditionally, critical discourse comes in "volumes" and renewed "editions", but {adiscourse.net} deals in "states" - a much more digital and natural form. Interacting with the irresolved database means means adding and reacting, but also looking at isolated frames of the discourse [getSTATE]. These states are frozen images - a little more coherent, but with a recognized loss. From one moment to the next they might be identical or drastically changed, just like plays in the evolution of a Go game.
      </span>
      <span style="color:black !important">
        <b>[anarchy]</b> : {adiscourse.net} is as attempt at materializing anarchist practice within the sphere of critical discourse production. Negotiating meanings, truth-concensuses and orientations of the network require an anarchic set of values - ones which constantly negotiate the terms between autonomy, social responsibility and solidarity. These exercises must take place in the streets, but also on the net. Foremost, they need to be pursued within each small area, creating novel interstitial spaces in which queer forms of action can be produced and engaged... ...and dismantled when necessary.
      </span>
      <span style="color:black !important">
        {adiscourse.net} is exactly that - a discourse among many within an undulating discursive field. By no means is this a suggested unitary manner of discursive exchange, but a project based around the idea that proliferative practices will allow for strange negotiations to take place and create an anarchic network of institial spaces and practices. As within any anarchic practice, it must be consistenly legitimized or negated, based on what is working now. No system deserves to be sustained
